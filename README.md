# react-webpack Nicholas boilerplate
This is a boilerplate which has almost all require package that you use for you widgets environments. 
Just remember 'npm install' the first time that you clone it and 
#npm run serve to lunch the server 
#npm run build to compile the modules and bundle it. 
All cdn's that you has to include, has to be done after the app is build. 
And if you want to try in an production enviroment, try using the ZDKS.

Good luck  !
